## Communication Board

Communication board is used to support communication between Scope representetives and Scope client representetives. Communication should be done in question and answer manner.
Question can be stated by both parties. Answer to the question should be given by other party. Questioning party should verify the answer and confirm satisfaction with the answer.

To provide visability on each question state we place each question in sepatrate card and group cards into lists

| List Name | Description | Who insert? |  Who monitor? | Where to move after processing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scope to answer** | Contains cards created by Client which must be answered by Scope | Client | Scope | **Client to verify** |
| **Client to answer** | Contains cards created by Scope which must be answered by Client | Scope | Client | **Scope to verify**  |
| **Client to verify** | Contains cards answered by Scope which Client must verify  | Scope | Client | **Closed** if answer is OK or **Scope to answer** if answer is not clear enough or additional details are needed |
| **Scope to verify** | Contains cards answered by Client which Scope must verify | Client | Scope | **Closed** if answer is OK or **Client to answer** if answer is not clear enough or additional details are needed |
| **Closed** | Card content is resolved and verified | Client or Scope | Nobody |   |

### Tips

1. Do not change or signifigly expand initial question of the card while returning the card to **x to answer** from **x to verify**, add new card instead
1. Every time you move card to **x to answer** from **x to verify**, you must place a comment in the card specifying why provided answer is not enough. 
1. Anyone can notice that initial question has changed or signifigly expanded. Anyone can ask initial card creator to create another card for side topics.  
1. Move card to **Closed** if you have decided that meeting is needed to get decision on card's topic, i.e. if discussion has moved out of the card, close the card.
1. Use Labels to identify question area, if needed
1. Write initial question in card description
